<h2>Oigin</h2>
<p>Latin dance is mainly derived from three styles: Native Latin, European, and African influences. The roots of Latin dance is deep and geographically embedded because it dates back to the fifteenth century when indigenous dances were first recorded by Europeans.The movement and rhythms of African influences left a permanent mark in Latin dance. When the African slaves entered Europe in the 1500s, they brought styles such as basic, simple movements (putting emphasis on the upper body, torso, or feet) and intricate movements like the coordination of different body parts and complex actions such as “fast rotation, ripples of the body, and contraction and release, as well as variations in dynamics, levels, and use of space.”[7] The difference between the African and European styles was that it included bent knees and a downward focus (grounded to the earth) rather than a straight-backed upward focus like the Europeans, and whole-foot steps than toes and heels. Such influences of African roots allowed the beauty and uniqueness of Latin dance.</p>
